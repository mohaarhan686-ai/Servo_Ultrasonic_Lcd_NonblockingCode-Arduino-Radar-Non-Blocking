# 🌟 Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a simple **Arduino Radar Scanner** using an **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor**, **Servo Motor**, and **16×2 I2C LCD**.

Unlike traditional Arduino projects that rely heavily on `delay()`, this project uses **millis() based scheduling** to perform multiple tasks independently, resulting in smoother servo movement and better code organization.

The servo continuously scans from **0° to 180°**, while the ultrasonic sensor measures object distance and the LCD displays the current distance and scanning angle in real time.
